=head1 NAME

MyCPAN::App::DPAN::Indexer - Create a D(ark)PAN out of the indexed distributions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use MyCPAN::Indexer;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements the indexer_class and reporter_class components
to allow C<backpan_indexer.pl> to create a CPAN-like directory structure
with its associated index files. This application of L<MyCPAN::Indexer> is
specifically aimed at creating a 02packages.details file, so it
strives to collect a minimum of information.

It runs through the indexing and prints a report at the end of the run.

# Override the exit from the parent class so we can embed a run
# inside a bigger application. Applications should override this
# on their own to do any final processing they want.

=item examine_dist_steps

Returns the list of techniques that C<examine_dist> should use
to index distributions. See the documentation in
C<MyCPAN::Indexer::examine_dist_steps>.

For DPAN, unpack the dist, ensure you are in the dist directory,
the find the modules.

sub examine_dist_steps {
	(
	#    method                error message                  fatal

	[ 'find_dist_dir',      "Did not find distro directory!",    1 ],
	[ 'find_modules',       "Could not find modules!",           1 ],
	[ 'examine_modules',    "Could not process modules!",        0 ],
	);
	}

=item find_module_techniques

Returns the list of techniques that C<find_modules> should use
to look for Perl module files. See the documentation in
C<MyCPAN::Indexer::find_modules>.

=item get_module_info_tasks

Returns the list of techniques that C<get_module_info> should use
to extract data from Perl module files. See the documentation in
C<MyCPAN::Indexer::get_module_info>.

=cut

sub get_module_info_tasks{
	(
	[ 'extract_module_namespaces',   'Extract the namespaces a file declares' ],

	)
	}

=item setup_run_info

Like C<setup_run_info> in C<MyCPAN::Indexer>, but it remembers fewer
things. The DarkPAN census really just cares about finding packages,
so the details about the run aren't as interesting.

=cut

sub setup_run_info {
#	TRACE( sub { get_caller_info } );

	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'root_working_dir', cwd()   );
	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'run_start_time',   time    );
	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'completed',        0       );
	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'pid',              $$      );
	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'ppid',             $_[0]->getppid );

	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'indexer',          ref $_[0] );
	$_[0]->set_run_info( 'indexer_versions', $_[0]->VERSION );

	return 1;
	}


=item setup_dist_info

Like C<setup_dist_info> in C<MyCPAN::Indexer>, but it remembers fewer
things. The test census really just cares about statements in the test
files, so the details about the distribution aren't as interesting.

=cut

sub setup_dist_info {
#	TRACE( sub { get_caller_info } );

	my( $self, $dist ) = @_;

	$logger->debug( "Setting dist [$dist]\n" );
	$self->set_dist_info( 'dist_file', $dist );

	return 1;
