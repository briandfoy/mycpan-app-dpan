=head1 NAME

MyCPAN::App::DPAN::SVNPostFlight - A No-op reports processor

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Use this from C<dpan> by specifying it as the C<postflight_class> class:

	# in dpan.conf
	postflight_class  MyCPAN::App::DPAN::SVNPostFlight
	postflight_dry_run 1

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class is an example for a user-defined class to run at the end of
C<dpan>'s normal processing. The class only needs to provide a C<run>
method, which is automatically called by C<dpan>. Be careful that you
don't import anything called C<run> (looking at you, C<IPC::Run>)!

This example checks that the DPAN directory is under source control,
invokes an svn update, checks the svn status to see what's changes,
and creates a list of svn commands to run. It adds any new files it
finds and removes any missing miles. If it detects a conflict, it
stops the process before anything happens.

If you've set the C<postflight_dry_run> configuration variable, this
class merely prints the svn adds and removes that it would run, but it
doesn't actually run them. That gives you a chance to see what it
would do without doing it.

At the end of the run, this prints the URL you need to use to access the
repository.

=head2 Logging

This module uses the C<PostFlight> logging category in the C<Log::Log4perl>
setup.

=head2 Writing your own

If you want to maek your own class, check out the source for C<run>. The
code comments explain what you should be doing. However, most of the
code in this example isn't specific to the post flight processing.

# Log::Log4perl should already be set up. The
BEGIN {
$logger = Log::Log4perl->get_logger( 'PostFlight' );
}

BEGIN {
my $svn = IPC::Cmd::can_run( 'svn' );
$logger->debug( "svn commmand is [$svn]" );

=item svn

Returns the path to the svn binary.

=cut

sub svn { $svn }

=item dry_run

Returns the value of the postflight_dry_run configuration directive.

=cut

sub dry_run { $_[0]->{postflight_dry_run} }

=item run_svn

Runs an svn command. During a dry run it merely prints the command to
standard output. Otherwise, it actually runs the svn command.

=cut

sub run_svn
	{
	my( $self, @commands ) = @_;

	if( $self->dry_run )

	else
		{
		$logger->debug( "$svn @commands" );
		print capturex( $self->svn, @commands );
		}
	}

}

=item run( $application )

Makes the hamsters go. This is called automatically from dpan. It gets
the application object as its argument.

	# You can add any configuration directive that you like. You might
	# want to give it a prefix that won't conflict with the standard
